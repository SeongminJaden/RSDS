# ROS2-Based Satellite Dynamics Simulation (LEO Orbit & Space Debris Removal)

## Project Overview
This project aims to simulate the orbital motion, attitude control, thrust, and space debris removal scenarios of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with realistic physics. The simulation is built on ROS2 and Gazebo, integrating accurate orbit prediction, dynamic modeling, and robotic arm manipulation using MoveIt.

## Key Features
- Orbit prediction and analysis based on TLE data using SGP4 and HPOP models
- Realistic environment physics including atmospheric drag and gravity
- Delta-V thrust and attitude control simulation
- Robotic arm path planning and control using MoveIt2
- Physical contact and joint formation between robotic arm and debris (FixedJoint)
- ROS2 topic and service based communication and data visualization

## Project Components
- `satellite_description/`: URDF/XACRO models for satellites and robotic arm
- `satellite_plugins/`: Custom Gazebo plugins (Drag, Thruster, Gripper, etc.)
- `satellite_control/`: ros2_control joint controller configurations
- `satellite_moveit/`: MoveIt2 configuration and robotic arm control package
- `satellite_utils/`: TLE parsing, orbit calculation, and trajectory utilities

## Orbit Data and Simulation
- TLE data sourced from [Celestrak](https://celestrak.com) or [Space-Track](https://www.space-track.org)
- Satellite position and velocity calculated using `pyorbital` or `sgp4` libraries
- Orbit simulation integrated with Gazebo physics engine for realistic dynamics

## Development Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS2: Humble or Iron
- Gazebo: Fortress or Garden
- MoveIt2 (latest stable version)
- C++ (for plugins), Python (for ROS nodes and orbit calculations)

## How to Run
1. Setup and build ROS2 workspace
    ```bash
    colcon build --packages-select satellite_description satellite_plugins satellite_control satellite_moveit satellite_utils
    source install/setup.bash
    ```
2. Launch the simulation
    ```bash
    ros2 launch satellite_sim satellite_sim.launch.py
    ```
3. Use MoveIt2 to control the robotic arm and visualize orbits

## Future Plans & Extensions
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras) for satellites
- Support for other orbits (MEO, GEO)
- Real-time orbit adjustment and collision avoidance
- Modeling sensor noise in space environment
